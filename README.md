# Food Festival

A front-end web application that provides the schedule, testimonials, and ticket purchasing for a (hypothetical) local food festival.

Given the starter code of a functioning app, I:
1. Increased its perfomance by running a Google Lighthouse audit and using webpack to bundle code, organize it efficiently, enable lazy loading, and minimize the size of all assets, and
2. Converted it to a progressive web application
