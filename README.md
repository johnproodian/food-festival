# Food Festival

A front-end web application that provides the schedule, testimonials, and ticket purchasing for a (hypothetical) local food festival.

Given the starter code of a functioning app:
1. I increased its perfomance by (a) running a Google Lighthouse audit and (b) using webpack to bundle code, organize it efficiently, enable lazy loading, and minimize the size of all assets, and
2. I converted it to a progressive web application
